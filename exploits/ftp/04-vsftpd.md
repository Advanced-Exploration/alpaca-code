### HTTP Detection

No detection of POST request pre-auth.

There is a detection of POST requests post-auth, but it that is
ineffective in mitigating cross-protocol attacks.

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
530 Please login with USER and PASS.
USER anonymous
230 Login successful.
POST / HTTP/1.1
500 HTTP protocol commands not allowed.
Connection closed by foreign host.
```

### Error tolerance

Yes, at least 100 errors allowed.

### Reflection

No reflections found pre-auth.

Post-auth, only post-for user with write permission. Using a bypass by [OWASP][1]:

```
ftp> mkdir "<img src='x' onerror=&#0000106 ... &#0000041>"
257 "/home/marcus/foo/<img src='x' onerror=&#0000106 ... &#0000041>" created
```
