## Courier IMAP

Name            | Version
:---------------|:--------------
Courier (IMAP)  | 5.0.6+1.0.6-1

### HTTP Detection

No detection of HTTP requests.

```
S: * OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1] Courier-IMAP ready. Copyright 1998-2016 Double Precision, Inc.  See COPYING for distribution information.
C: GET /get HTTP/1.1
S: GET NO Error in IMAP command received by server.
(...)
```

### Error Tolerance

No, Courier aborts the connection after ten errors. However, the
counter is reset on each valid command, so a bypass may be possible if
the browser provides enough flexibility in setting custom HTTP
headers.

### Reflection

Yes, pre-auth reflection is possible using the tag.

```

<script>alert`XSS`</script> xxx
<script>alert`XSS`</script> NO Error in IMAP command received by server.
